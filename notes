1.get rid of the words that is not important and try to find useful pattern.
2.maybe do 2 gram processing?
3.we load database to panda datafram so we can process it better.
4.we wrote a program to do the processing
5.we used stop words to aovid unneceesary data, in the future we might add more.
6.we used 2 gram we get combination of words when we got not good result for 1
gram.
7.cross validation.
8.we are using pytorch model so we understand how pytorch model works and that
is not taught in class.
9.build more layers or 
10. make notes during research.
11. make google docs.
12. parameterize the model and control the complexity.
13. used bag of words text presentation
14. embedding model
15. use cross validation to choose the best model according to test result.
16. store the result in a text file to see how our model is improving.
17. change the loss function and activating function
