1. PyTorch has two primitives to work with data: torch.utils.data.DataLoader and torch.utils.data.Dataset. Dataset stores the samples and their corresponding labels, and DataLoader wraps an iterable around the Dataset.
2. pass the Dataset as an argument to DataLoader. This wraps an iterable over our dataset, and supports automatic batching, sampling, shuffling and multiprocess data loading.
Tensors are a specialized data structure that are very similar to arrays and matrices.
